            <h3 class="therules">Players must perform the dare they are given, or truthfully answer the question asked. Answers must not be related to the game. Players are not permitted to change their minds about choosing "truth" or "dare" after having had the slip of paper read out to them. "Passing" can be an option, but requires a punishment which will be chosen by the last person that chose the same option.

            <a href="neverhiever.html" .color=white><h2>never have I ever</h2></a>
            <h3 class="therules">The first player starts by saying a simple statement about something they have never done before starting with "Never have I ever". Anyone who at some point in their life has done the action that the first player says, must drink. Then the game continues around the circle, and the next person makes a statement.
